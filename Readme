this program is about admission prediction: it predicts the candidate that re 
to be accepted and rejected into computer science department.


After runnung the code, it can be seen from the decision tree that postutme was
the main point of giving admission and if you score 45.6 and above you will be 
accepted and if you score below the your jamb score will be used, if you scored 
below 45.5 and your jamb score is 206 and above you will be admitted other wise
rejected.


***********Installation***********

  check the right side and below... u will see all the files in the folder
  right click and click import dataset  an interface will open, after it has been loaded 
  click import
 run coad.R by clicking Run on each line 
 **** R executes one by one. and the answers varies.. u might get different 
 ans since it shuffles the train and test data
